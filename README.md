# 8-Puzzle-Problem
This repository contains an implementation of the A* search algorithm for solving the classic 8-puzzle problem. The 8-puzzle is a sliding puzzle consisting of a 3x3 grid with numbered tiles (1-8) and one empty space. The goal is to rearrange the tiles to match a given goal state by sliding them into the empty space.
